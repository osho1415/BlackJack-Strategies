# BlackJack-Strategies
Ran Monte-Carlo simulations to compare the final outcomes of various betting strategy in BlackJack.


This project simulates multiple games of BlackJack, with multiple rounds each game, with one player to compare the various betting strategies. The game itself is played using a intermediate strategy which is influenced by the following guidelines: 

* Hard Hands (No Aces):
  * 8 or less: Always hit.
  * 9: Double down against dealer's 3-6, otherwise hit.
  * 10 or 11: Double down unless the dealer has an Ace or a 10-value card, then hit.
  * 12-16: Stand against dealer's 2-6, otherwise hit.
  * 17 or higher: Always stand.
* Iteam 2
* 

The outcome of the simulation is graphed as a line chart, similar to the example below.
